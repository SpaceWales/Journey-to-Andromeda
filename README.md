# Journey-to-Andromeda

A hot take on Oregon Trail, you start out with finite resources (ammo,crew,fuel,hitpoints) 
and must make your way through a series of galaxies and survive attacks by pirates and the 
dangers of space travel! Buy supplies at trade outposts, destroy enemies and loot their 
burned corpses, and stay alive!
